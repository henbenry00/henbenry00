## About Me

- Currently been doing a lot of server configuration and self hosting for many different apps and services
- I also make some cool music / audio setups, and I’m not afraid of crazy signal chains.
- Currently experimenting with:
  - `React` + `TypeScript` for web apps  
  - `Python` & `PowerShell` for automation  
  - **DevOps-ish** workflows for small projects (CI, tests, containers, etc.)

> I like building stuff that’s _actually_ used — not just tutorial graveyards.

---

## What I’m Focusing On

- **Frontend:** Deep-diving into `React` ecosystem (hooks, context, router, state management)
- **Modern Dev:** Getting comfortable with AI-assisted development & prompt-driven workflows
- **Infra & IT:** Scripting, automation, and secure configurations in real-world environments
